The GIVdrop is designed to kickstart the GIVeconomy by distributing GIV tokens to the Giveth trusted seed - crypto philanthropists, Giveth users & builders, Blockchain4Good DAO members, and other ecosystem partners. To check your GIVdrop eligibility or to claim [click here](https://giveth.io/claim). To learn how to claim your GIVdrop, refer to our tutorial below.

All addresses have [until Decemember 24, 2022](https://forum.giveth.io/t/ending-the-givdrop/880) to claim their GIVdrop. After that, any unclaimed tokens will be returned to the Giveth DAO.

## GIVdrop Eligibility

17.05% of the total initial supply (1 billion GIV) has been distributed to our trusted seed. The trusted seed is a group of individuals - previous supporters  10% of these tokens are instantly claimable on Gnosis Chain (formerly xDai Network) as the GIVdrop. The rest initializes and sustains [the GIVstream](https://docs.giveth.io/giveconomy/givstream) - a flow of GIV that becomes claimable gradually and continuously until December 23, 2026.

Eligible recipients of the GIVdrop and the associated GIVstream include:

- Giveth Contributors 5.05%
- Past donors to Giveth directly 4%
- Blockchain4Good heroes 4%
- Past donors to projects on Giveth 2%
- Past users of beta Giveth TRACE 1%
- Past donors to Gitcoin Grants in Rounds 1-7 1%

The Blockchain4Good DAO heroes group includes a list of over 2500 unique addresses, with over 60 different groupings. The majority of addresses belong to people who have been identified as crypto donors, with the rest belonging to value-aligned DAO members that are working, directly or indirectly, to further [Giveth's mission](https://docs.giveth.io/whatisgiveth/). You may have a GIVdrop if you are part of any of these groups (and many others!):

- 1Hive
- ChievMint
- clr.fund
- Commons Stack Trusted Seed
- Crypto Commons Gathering
- Ethereum Foundation
- General Magic
- MetaCartel DAO
- MetaGame
- MetaGammaDelta
- MolochDAO
- STAKEhausDAO
- TEC Hatchers
- TrojanDAO
- Vocdoni
- WeTrust
- WhalerDAO


<span class="importantText">The snapshot for past donors and Giveth users was taken in March 2021.</span> The snapshot for contributors (builders) and Blockchain4Good DAO heroes was taken in September 2021. <span class="importantText">For donors to Gitcoin Grants, GIVdrop eligibility was for those who donated in <i><u>at least two rounds</u></i> from rounds 1-8.</span> Our snapshot was taken at those times because the token development was all public, and we didn't want to give all of the GIV to the airdrop hunters that have proliferated throughout the past year.

:::info
We have made every effort to include all valid addresses in this GIVdrop made at our discretion. Not every person who has ever interacted with Giveth is eligible. If you did not receive GIV, that is because you were not eligible or the wallet that stores the address that was eligible can not be accessed. We will not review past transactions or consider other addresses for inclusion. We appreciate your understanding.

If you did not receive the GIVdrop, check out our [GIVbacks program](https://giveth.io/givbacks) to find out how to get GIV!
:::

**NOTE:** If you received the GIVdrop but no longer have access to the eligible address, it is possible for us to redirect the allocation to another ETH address. However, you need to prove who you are and that you do have tokens allocated to you. If this is you, reach out to our team for support. FYI - if no one in the Giveth team knows you, it probably won't work out.

## Claiming your GIVdrop

The GIVdrop was released on December 24, 2021. In this guide we'll walk you through how to claim your GIV on the GIVdrop claim page.

First thing is to head over to [the GIVdrop claim page](https://giveth.io/claim); you should arrive at this screen:

<img alt='check GIVdrop eligibility' src={useBaseUrl('/img/content/giveconomy/claimConnect1.png')} />

From here you will need to connect your web3 wallet to the DApp to check your eligibility.

After connecting, one of three situations will happen:

1. <a href="#1-givdrop-to-claim">You have a GIVdrop to claim, NICE!</a>
2. <a href="#2-the-address-provided-has-already-claimed-its-givdrop">The address provided has already claimed its GIVdrop, GREAT!</a>
3. <a href="#3-you-missed-the-givdrop-sad-face"> You missed the GIVdrop. :( </a>

Click on any of the above situations to learn how to proceed. To learn more about GIVdrop eligibility, click [here](./givdrop).

Or if you want to be a real GIVhero, participate in the GIVbacks program. You can qualify to earn GIV from donating to verified projects on [giveth.io](https://giveth.io/projects/). Learn more about the [GIVbacks program here](./givbacks).

### If you get stuck in the GIVdrop claim:
You could find yourself stuck in the GIVdrop Connect page for a variety of reasons including:
- Declining to connect your wallet in MetaMask
- Not connected to Gnosis Chain (formerly xDai Network)

To remedy this, open up your MetaMask extension, and verify your connection:
<img alt='troubleshooting getting stuck' src={useBaseUrl('/img/content/giveconomy/claimStuck1.png')} />

Ensure you're on Gnosis Chain (formerly xDai Network), and connect the wallet you'd like to claim for to the DApp. If the page doesn't update automatically just give it a quick refresh (F5), and you should be good to go!
