## Sign in

In the top right corner you will see the `sign in` button. Currently you can sign in via two methods, either by *Tor.us*, *Metamask*, *Wallet Connect* or *Gnosis Safe*. You must choose!

#### Sign in with Ethereum
Click the button and choose which wallet you would like to connect with (Metamask, WalletConnect, Torus or Gnosis Safe). Follow your wallet instructions below.


#### Tor.us Sign in
Click on the `Torus` under the sign in drop down menu. You will be given several options of different platforms you can sign in with (e.g., Google, Linkedin, Twitter, Discord, etc.) You can also use the simple email option, which will send you a one-time use code to your email. Follow the Torus prompt and you should find your way in easily.

#### Metamask Sign in
If you're unfamiliar with Metamask or don't already have a wallet, head on over to (https://metamask.io/), and get yourself set up with one! Once your wallet is setup, make sure your Metamask browser extension is enabled and up to date. Click the 'Metamask' option under the sign in drop down menu. You should then be prompted by the Metamask pop up to confirm your signature, and then you should be plugged in and good to go!

#### Wallet Connect
Click on the Wallet Connect icon and scan the QR code with a Wallet Connect compatible wallet or copy to your clipboard. Alternatively, click the desktop tab and choose your preferred wallet.

#### Gnosis Safe Sign in
To sign in with Gnosis you must access Giveth from your Gnosis safe. Click Gnosis safe and follow the prompts.
