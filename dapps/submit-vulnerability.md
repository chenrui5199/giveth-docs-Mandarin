# Reporting a Security Issue or Vulnerability

## Smart Contract security
If you believe you’ve identified a smart contract issue or vulnerability, please submit a report via [Hats.finance anon-friendly submission portal](https://app.hats.finance/vulnerability) 

1. On that page, under ‘Select Project’, search for ‘Giveth’
2. enter the details of the security issue via the form.

*Using this method will encrypt your communications with Giveth’s security team, and will use the Hat’s bug bounty system which you can learn more about [in the hats.finance documentation](https://docs.hats.finance/).*

## Service vulnerability
If you believe you have identified a security vulnerability on the backend or in the way our deployments work, you are also welcome to email the security team directly at `security@giveth.io`, with the subject line “Bug Bounty Program Submission”. 
The email should include:
- a detailed description of the vulnerability and steps to reproduce it. 
- Please also include your Arbitrum wallet address for reward distribution. 
- If you wish to encrypt your message to us, our public PGP key is available [HERE](https://gist.github.com/geleeroyale/745bf235baae31de87bd270141736605).  

Once the report is received, the Giveth security team will review the vulnerability and respond with a determination of its validity and severity. If the report is valid, the team will work to fix the vulnerability and distribute the reward to the reporter.
