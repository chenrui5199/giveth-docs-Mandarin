# Giveth Referral Program


The [Giveth referral program](https://giveth.io/referral) is a way for users to earn rewards for donating to good causes and inviting their friends and network to do the same. With every donation made on Giveth, users can earn extra GIV tokens through the [GIVbacks program](https://docs.giveth.io/giveconomy/givbacks).

With this new referral program, users can earn even more rewards! By encouraging their friends and network to donate on Giveth through their own referral link, users can earn up to 50% of their friend's GIVbacks as well (an equivalent of up to 40% of the value of the donation amount).

## How much can you earn?


For this initial launch of the program, you could receive up to 50% of the GIVbacks for any referred donations! If you refer someone to donate $100, you could receive the equivalent of up to $40 in GIV rewards! ðŸ¤¯
Who is eligible to participate?


This referral program is open to everyone! It doesn't matter if you're a project owner, a recurrent donor or just a passionate person for public goods. If you'd like to increase your rewards and positive impact, you can generate your own referral link and share it on social media, your website and favorite community channels.

For the first time, with the referral program project owners will be able to earn GIVbacks too, every time a donation is made through their referral link.
Past donors can also use the program to earn GIVbacks without actually donating: by sharing their referral links and getting rewarded for donations made to their favorite projects.

## How to get started


Simply go to the [Giveth Chainvine website](https://app.chainvine.xyz/giveth), connect your wallet, then copy your unique link from the "Your Referral Link" section, and start sharing it to encourage your network to give to good causes.

That's it! You'll now be eligible for rewards in our next [GIVbacks round](https://docs.giveth.io/giveconomy/givbacks) (2 weeks intervals). Not only will you be making a positive impact, but you'll also be earning rewards (up to 50% of the GIVbacks amount from the donation) for your efforts.

## How rewards work

For the initial phase of this program, you can earn up to 50% of the GIVbacks amount for anyone you refer!

This calculation varies based on the status of the referred donor: a new user to Giveth or an existing Giveth user (someone who has interacted with the Giveth dApp in the past).

### For new users

You will earn 50% of the GIVbacks for a given donor in the current and subsequent GIVbacks rounds. For example, if you refer a new user to donate in GIVbacks round 30, you will be entitled to 50% of all GIVbacks generated from all donations made in GIVbacks round 30 and 31 from that user.

### For existing users you refer

You will earn 50% of the GIVbacks that would have been allocated to that user for a period of 24 hours from when that user clicks on your referral link. For example, if a returning user clicks on your referral link at 9am, you will be entitled to 50% of all GIVbacks generated from all donations made by that user until 9am the following day (24 hours).
