## Find a project that you like.
Have a good look at the projects already created, read the descriptions, and do your homework! 

You can browse projects through different categories and sort them by [GIVpower](./GIVpower.md) rank or other options.

Once you find a project you would like to donate to, hit the `DONATE` button.



#### Crypto Donations
Projects accept ETH and a wide variety of ERC-20 tokens on Mainnet, Gnosis Chain, Polygon, Celo, and Optimism, allowing for donations with different tokens within these networks.
