# Adding Updates to Your Project


Are you the proud owner of a verified project on Giveth? If so, it's important to keep your donors in the loop and maintain your active status by posting updates every 3 months. 

If your project isnâ€™t verified, posting updates is optional. However, it is always helpful. Providing updates that show the impact of donations helps to build trust with potential donors and previous donors are more likely to continue donating. You can show impact in numerous ways such as posting measurable results and statistics and sharing case studies, stories, and videos. 



Don't worry, it's easy! Simply sign in to your account and click on the `Updates` section of your project page. 

<img alt="Add Project Update" src={useBaseUrl('img/content/updates1.png')} />



From there, select a title that accurately reflects the content of your update. 

<img alt="Edit Project Update" src={useBaseUrl('img/content/updates2.png')} />


But don't stop there! As mentioned above, adding relevant content such as photos, videos, and receipts will show your donors exactly where their funds are going and build a relationship of trust.

Remember that staying active and keeping your donors informed is the key to success when it comes to your Giveth project.
